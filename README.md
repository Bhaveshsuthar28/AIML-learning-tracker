# AIML-learning-tracker

This repository contains a collection of scripts and datasets used for learning and experimenting with fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a focus on data manipulation and analysis using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.

## Project Structure

The workspace is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose in the learning process.

### Data Files

-   [indian.csv](indian.csv): The raw, unprocessed dataset containing sample employee information. This file includes various data quality issues such as missing values (`nan`), infinities (`inf`), negative values in inappropriate fields, and duplicates.
-   [Indian_employe.csv](Indian_employe.csv): The cleaned and preprocessed version of the employee data, generated by the `Indian.py` script.

### Core Scripts

-   [`Indian.py`](Indian.py): A Python script that performs a comprehensive data cleaning process on `indian.csv`. It handles missing values, infinite values, negative numbers, and duplicates, and then saves the cleaned data into `Indian_employe.csv`.
-   [`fIleTypeConverstion.py`](fIleTypeConverstion.py): A simple utility script to convert the `indian.csv` file into an Excel format (`.xlsx`).

### Learning Modules

#### `/Python`

This directory contains scripts covering fundamental Python concepts.
-   [`Basic.py`](Python/Basic.py): Demonstrates basic data types, functions, and list/dictionary operations.
-   [`OOPS.py`](Python/OOPS.py): Covers the basics of Object-Oriented Programming, including classes, objects, and exception handling.
-   [`Lambda.py`](Python/Lambda.py): Explores the use of lambda functions with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
-   [`fileHandling.py`](Python/fileHandling.py): Shows a basic example of file creation and path checking.

#### `/Numpy`

This directory is dedicated to learning the NumPy library for numerical operations.
-   [`Numpy.1.py`](Numpy/Numpy.1.py): Introduction to NumPy arrays, their attributes (`ndim`, `shape`, `dtype`), and properties.
-   [`Numpy.2.py`](Numpy/Numpy.2.py): Covers array creation functions (`zeros`, `ones`, `arange`), indexing, slicing, and the concept of vectorization.
-   [`Numpy.3.py`](Numpy/Numpy.3.py): Focuses on array manipulation, including reshaping and concatenation.
-   [`Numpy.4.py`](Numpy/Numpy.4.py): Demonstrates various mathematical operations on arrays.
-   [`Numpy.5.py`](Numpy/Numpy.5.py): Explains how to handle missing (`NaN`) and infinite (`inf`) values in NumPy arrays.

#### `/Pandas`

This directory contains scripts for learning data analysis with the Pandas library.
-   [`pandas.1.py`](Pandas/pandas.1.py): Reading from a CSV file and creating a DataFrame from a dictionary.
-   [`pandas.2.py`](Pandas/pandas.2.py): Inspecting a DataFrame using `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
-   [`pandas.3.py`](Pandas/pandas.3.py): Selecting columns and filtering rows based on conditions.
-   [`pandas.4.py`](Pandas/pandas.4.py): Adding, modifying, and removing columns and rows from a DataFrame.
-   [`pandas.5.py`](Pandas/pandas.5.py): Techniques for handling missing data, such as dropping or filling `NaN` values.
-   [`pandas.6.py`](Pandas/pandas.6.py): Using interpolation to fill missing data points.
-   [`pandas.7.py`](Pandas/pandas.7.py): Sorting data, calculating aggregate statistics, and grouping data using `groupby()`.
-   [`pandas.8.py`](Pandas/pandas.8.py): Merging and joining multiple DataFrames.

## How to Run

To clean the raw dataset, execute the main data processing script from your terminal:

```sh
python Indian.py
```

This will read the data from [`indian.csv`](indian.csv "indian.csv"), perform all the cleaning and transformation steps, and output the results to [`Indian_employe.csv`](Indian_employe.csv "Indian_employe.csv").
